# House Price Prediction Model  

This repository contains a **Machine Learning model** designed to predict house prices based on various features such as **location, BHK, interior design, and floor level**. The model is built using **Linear Regression** and achieves an accuracy of **75%** on the test dataset.  

## Features  
- Utilizes **Supervised Learning** for price prediction.  
- Trained using **Linear Regression** to estimate house prices accurately.  
- Achieves **75% accuracy** on the test dataset.
  
##  Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** 
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data handling) 
- **Scikit-learn** (for building the model)   

##  Dataset  
The dataset consists of **200 records** containing key features such as:  
- **Location**  
- **Number of BHKs**  
- **Floor level** 
- **Interior design **  
- **Market price trends**   

##  Important Note  
> This model is trained on a dataset containing information from only **200 individuals**, which may introduce some variations in predictions. The accuracy may improve with a **larger dataset** and further **hyperparameter tuning**.
